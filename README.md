# HurryType

HurryType is a small typing challenge, inspired by the likes of [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/), developped using React.js and Vite for the front and Node.js and express for the back, and MongoDB for the database.

## Install and launch

With npm and MongoDB installed, clone the repo, and then install the dependencies using

```bash
npm run install:all
```

The front-end, back-end and DB can be launched with

```bash
npm run dev
```

And then the challenge can be accessed at [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/)
